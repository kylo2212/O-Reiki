Holistic Healing

This website was created to complete a Web Development Class for college. I have plans to organize the files better and make the code easier to read. It is a little bit of a mess from learning by trial and error. I want to expand on this idea, maybe even start over and make it better now that I have had more experience and more classes to use toward a website. 

The content of the website is something that I personally have been taught to do so it does mean something to me and I would like to expand on this better as well.
